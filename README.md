# Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
This is the WebScraping project repo. The files are a bit clumped so I am adding a brief overview of the files and folders here.

### 1. [nav.py](https://github.com/Dibya-tech/Web-Scraping/blob/main/nav.py) 
- This file has the script to use selenium to go to GDACS site and then set all the filters and download the recent 100 htmls for each event. 
- The start_date has been defined in the file in variable **"start_date"**, and then we are storing the files in a folder with subfolders for each event in the variable **output_dir** in the **htmlFilesDownloader( )**.
